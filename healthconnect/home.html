            <h2>The Healthcare Access Challenge</h2>
            <p>Millions of people, particularly in rural areas, face challenges accessing quality healthcare. Long wait times, lack of specialists, and geographical barriers hinder access to healthcare, leaving vulnerable populations underserved.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>60% of rural residents travel over 10 kilometers for healthcare.</li>
                <li>Rising chronic diseases require regular consultations that are not always available.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Solution: HealthConnect</h2>
